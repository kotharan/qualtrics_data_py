For Ms. Priscilla's Code [../SummerWork-2/Each_School_data.py] ::

			** BEFORE ADDING A NEW DOCUMENT READ THIS**

1. The file exported from Qualtrics is generally a  .CSV although to run with the Code it needs to be .xslx , therefore before adding convert it from .CSV to .xlsx
	- You cam simply do that by exporting(Save as) the CSV file as a .xlsx file.


2. The new document should be in then same folder where the code is.

3. The new data document should be named as "outdoor2.xlsx" because the code searches for data file with that name in same folder where the code is located.

4. If you are adding a new file make sure you are deleting or renaming the previous data file to something other than "outdoor2.xlsx".
	
	
			** AFTER RUNNING THE CODE **

1. The OUTPUT file would be created in the same folder where the code is. 

	Note :: There is no need to rename the OUTPUT file it just updates every time you run the code.
