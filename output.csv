Next year's 5th grade class includes a significant number of second-language students, as well as a number of high-needs special special education students.  To fulfill the commitment (Yours AND Ours) of providing access to Outdoor School for all students,  we anticipate sending at least two additional staff with the 5th graders- one language specialist and one Special Education Behavior Specialist.  When those two specialists attend Outdoor school, they will require substitutes back at school to work with the rest of their case loads for those 3 days.  Those costs are reflected in this application under Program Costs (see above) that will appear slightly higher than the two other small schools that won't require substitute teachers.  

This year, the grant funded MES Outdoor School at Camp Tamarack (3-day 2-night). Our 2017-18 application did not include a stipend for staff.  Based on the huge personal investment our teachers made this year leaving their families to take their students to Outdoor School, this current application does include a stipend, (5 teachers/specialists for 96 students) and also reflects only slight increases for costs anticipated by the camp and by our transportation contractor. 

As you can see, beyond the cost of subs for our attending specialists, our application is requesting only a small amount to cover other program costs.  We hope to be able to absorb any additional program costs over the course of next school year within our existing general program budget."
